The following notebook was uploaded to Kaggle and is used to make the csv file. I do not use an optimizer or data augmentation. 
For a simple dataset like AGNews, I desired to not overcomplicate the model as it was already scoring above 
90%. Changing parameters such as the learning rate significantly reduced performance.
